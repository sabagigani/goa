 on October 4, 2023. The artwork consists of an anthropomorphic dog wearing a grey sweater, blue jeans, and red sneakers, giving off a "chill" expression by smirking with his hands in his pockets. While the artwork had some success after publishing, it only became viral about a year later on August 30, 2024, when a user on TikTok made a slideshow with the artwork, combining it with other popular memes at the time.

The artwork became <br> viral a second time on November 20, 2024, primarily on TikTok, inspiring the meme coin $CHILLGUY which rapidly rose to a market <br> cap of $488 million, driven in part by a post by Salvadorian president Nayib Bukele on Twitter in support of the coin. The resulting popularity of the coin and unauthorized use of the artwork for commercial gain led Banks to copyright the artwork and issue takedowns of "unauthorized merchandise and shitcoins" trying to make a profit, not including fanart or brands using it in the trends.
