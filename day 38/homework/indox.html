        Going into this show, I knew next to nothing about “League of Legends.” I knew that the game was a multiplayer online battle arena and that there was a character named Jinx, but that was about it. So when I say that I didn’t know what to expect out of this show, I really mean I had no idea what I was getting into. Thankfully, “Arcane” was incredible. This was by far one of the most unique and engrossing shows that I’ve seen in a while. From the story and characters, to the animation and direction, everything in this show oozes personality.
